Just built a fully automated AI Voice Agent for appointment booking!

I recently completed a powerful automation project using Retell AI, Google Calendar, and Zoom — and I’m really excited to share the results.

Here’s what I built:

✅ Inbound AI Voice Receptionist
Handles customer calls automatically and speaks naturally with callers.

✅ Collects Client Details
The agent asks for name, service type, preferred date, and time.

✅ Real-Time Google Calendar Availability Check
It checks available time slots instantly before confirming anything.

✅ Auto-Booking in Google Calendar
Once the caller selects a slot, the system books it directly into the calendar.

✅ Automatic Zoom Meeting Creation
A unique Zoom meeting link is generated for every appointment.

✅ Instant Confirmation Message
The client receives a confirmation with:

Appointment details

Zoom meeting link

Booking reference

🎯 Result: A fully automated appointment system operating 24/7 — no manual work, no missed calls, and a professional experience for every customer.

I'm proud of how smoothly this voice agent works end-to-end.
